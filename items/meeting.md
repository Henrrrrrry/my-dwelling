Meeting Minutes

*1.Establish the team project theme*

\* Hongyu Li provided an update on the project theme, suggesting that we design an app to assess building safety and disaster resilience based on the theme "Sustainable Cities and Communities: Building inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements." The team discussed the proposal and agreed to pursue this idea.

\* Yujing Zhang shared an alternative idea, proposing that we design an activity notification app to facilitate the participation of indigenous people in economic activities, based on the theme "Indigenous peoples and their communities engage in and benefit fully from economic activities." Juliang Xiao suggested another option, designing an app to track students' educational experiences, in line with the theme "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education."

\* Xinfei Li proposed an app to help indigenous people learn indigenous language, based on the theme "Indigenous peoples' cultures and languages are strong, supported and flourishing." 

After discussion, the team agreed to focus on Hongyu Li's proposal of designing an app to assess building safety and disaster resilience.

The team brainstormed ideas for the selected project, with Hongyu Li proposing features such as a database of building safety standards, a user-friendly interface for inputting building information, and a rating system for disaster resilience.

*2.Clarify the content required for Checkpoint 1*

Checkpoint 1 (W7/8, about 50% of the project time): 

• have a schedule of development activities, and consistent progress (shown in the Git history)

• the roles of each member, and tasks distribution (basic tasks evenly distributed to all members) 

• at least one meeting minute committed to the repository 

• A (well-thought) planned structure of your code (Code skeleton in your project or UML) 

• completed or have substantial progress in the basic features

*3. Assign tasks for the Checkpoint*

Juliang Xiao's responsibility:

In charge of writing the minutes for the first group meeting.

Hongyu Li's responsibility:

Responsible for creating the Skeleton for the entire project, including Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, etc.

Yujing Zhang's responsibility:

Responsible for developing the overall project schedule and deadlines for each phase.

Xinfei Li's responsibility:

Responsible for drafting the group's internal Conflict Resolution Protocol.

Xinrui Zhang's responsibility:

Responsible for creating the group's Task Assignment plan.

*4.Discusse the potential features that could be implemented based on the selected theme*

After discussion, we found that the five basic code functions - login, DataFiles, LoadShowData, DataStream, and Search - are relatively easy to implement. From the custom features of the app, we selected several functions to enhance our application:

1\. [Data-GPS] Use GPS information based on location data in your App. (easy)

`   `a. (Hint: see the demo presented by our tutors).

2\. [Data-Graphical] Create a Graphical report viewer to see a report of some useful data from your app. No marks will be awarded if the report is non-graphical. (medium)

3\. [Search-Filter] Sort and filter a list of items returned from searches, with the use of suitable UI components. (easy)

4\. [UI-Layout] Incorporate suitable layout adjustments in the UI components for portrait and landscape layout variants, as well as different screen sizes. (easy)

`   `a. No marks awarded by only using Android studio's automated support for orientation and screen sizes without proper adjustments.

5\. [Data-Profile] Create a Profile Page for Users or any Entities, which contains a media file (image, animation (e.g., gif), video). (easy)

6\. [Interact-Follow] The ability to 'follow' items. There must be a section that presents all the items followed by a user, grouped, and ordered. [stored in-memory] (medium)

7\. [Privacy-Visibility] Given there are at least two types of visibility (public, private, ...), users can only see some profiles or contents that are set to Public or after request being accepted. (easy)



Task Assigned To Due Date

We set the task submission deadline for April 19th at noon.
